# STAT-390: Data Science Project

The present document aims to provide guidance on navigating the files contained in this repository, as they are presented.

-   The `data` folder contains both raw and processed univariate and multivariate data used for the project, as well as the codebook provided on Kaggle.

-   The `data_frames` folder houses the final metrics for each model type constructed by Maria.

-   The `xgboost_components` folder contains saved components of Maria's XGBoost model, to avoid the repetition of computationally demanding code.
  
-   Documents prefixed with `0_` through `4_` correspond to files from group members used in model building.

-   The final models; as all of Maria's models exhibited the best RMSEs, her models, including all of Professor Shi's feedback, were renamed with the `FINAL_` prefix.

-   Documents prefixed with `meena_reworked_` are Meena's attempts to incorporate Professor Shi's feedback on Maria's models, shared during the last group call. Note that these edits were completely redone and are reflected in the documents with the `FINAL_` prefix, reworked by Maria herself.
